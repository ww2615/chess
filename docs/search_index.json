We can first start by considering the simple case. 5.1.1 Time Left, Spent by Move Type The distribution of Time Left and Time Spent by the type of moves people make. This graph provides a very unique insight to the correlation. For Time Left: Normal moves have the biggest std as expected. People have less Time Left after they make a blunder or mistake Dubious moves are mostly made in the first 40 second of the game. This may imply that dubious moves are part of the opening. When the time left reaches 5 minutes and 1 minutes, sudden fluctuations were found for the count of moves It is believed that 10 seconds, 1 minute and 5 minutes acted as a psychological catalyst that urged players to make a move For both fluctuations at 5mins and 1min, we can see the curves for normal moves peak earlier than the other type of moves and the other moves almost peaked at the same time. However, dubious moves happened the most when there are 5 minutes left while mistake moves happened the most when there is only 1 minute left. When the time left is less than 10 seconds, the distribution of the moves changed. Normal moves are made the most. For Time Spent: Normal moves are made fast. Normal moves may be obvious given the position Normal moves may be automatically played during the opening. Blunder takes more average time than any other type of move. This is less obvious. We think blunders are made fast without thought. Mistakes also take more time than normal moves. This is a heatmap of Time Left - Time Spent per type of move. It becomes evident that people play bad moves early in the game 5.1.2 Time ratio by Move Letâ€™s define ratio = Time Spent / Time Left. This concept of ratio is helpful in the sense that the person could have spent more time considering the position. For instance, given 1 second of time left and the player makes a move in 1 second, then there is less possibility that the player would have detected a better move. However, given 60 second of time left and the player makes a move in 1 second and blunder, this is a bad decision and probably the player should have thought more before they made the move. ## X Type mean std ## 1 1 dubious 0.1424937 0.1303141 ## 2 2 mistake 0.1668489 0.1409064 ## 3 3 blunder 0.1771698 0.1542783 ## 4 4 normal 0.2248049 0.1818782 From this graph, The mean of normal moves are much higher than other moves. Normal moves are a result of higher ratio of Time Spent / Time. Dubious moves are most likely intended or result of bad understanding early on in the game. Mistakes and blunders are also a result of not enough thinking. Players could have spent much more time thinking about the position and not blundering. 5.1.3 Quality of move during low time Players have to make decisions in a short period of time and the quality of decision is related to time. Using Time ratio is one of the ways to study the relationship 5.1.3.1 Quality of moves when remaining time is low 5.1.3.2 Quality of moves when time spent is low 5.2 Investigating how the games ended Most of the games end normally with results of either one of the players win or the match is tied. However, we see that over 10% of the games ended with someone ran out of time. From this graph, The majority of matches ended within 25 moves, however, matches that end with one player ran out of time were mostly happening at 35 moves. Number of matches ended with the reason of rules infraction is neglectable. 5.2.1 Use of pieces at the end game The majority of non draw games ended with Queen being the last piece to move, followed by Rook. However, in draw games, King and Queen are most frequently used pieces for the last move. Taking the different kinds of mate into factor and faceting the data by the result, we can see that Black and White side has extremely close distribution for the three types of Mate when it comes to wnning. Knight is the most used piece for a normal mate, followed by Bishop and Pawn. However, if it is a missed mate, Queen would be the most used piece. King would be the most used piece when it is a hung mate. In games that had results of Draw, the distribution is different with King being the most used one if it is a hung mate. This graph plots with the four most frequently used pieces for winning move. The relationship between Time ratio and Move number gave some extra insights to the use of peices at the end game As expected, King has the widest span on the Move number axis and has the lowest Time ratio. Long span on the Move number shows that King tends to survive longer as King is the most valuable piece which determines the winner of the game so any move made to it should be thoughtful and careful, thus, a lower time ratio. With Queen, Rook, and Bishop not being that decisive to the outcome of the game compared to King, we can see all of them has a lower span on the Move number axis. 5.2.2 Time left and time ratio when the losers ran out of time It could be seen that the majority of players who won because their opponent ran out of time had suffucient time left. Most of them had more than 30 seconds left. Considering time forfeit games only, time ratio of the winner are mostly below 10% while the density plot shows it concentrated at Time ratio = 2 and Move Number = 30. Also, we can observe that there are less outliers for time ratio when the move number is very high. It is believed that games that have a hugh amount of moves would result in smaller time ratio as there is not much time left.
