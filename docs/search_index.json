We can first start by considering the simple case. 5.1.1 Time Left, Spent by Move Type The distribution of Time Left and Time Spent by the type of moves people make. This graph provides a very unique insight to the correlation. For Time Left: Normal moves have the biggest std as expected. People have less Time Left after they make a blunder or mistake Dubious moves are mostly made in the first 40 second of the game. This may imply that dubious moves are part of the opening. When the time left reaches 5 minutes and 1 minutes, sudden fluctuations were found for the count of moves It is believed that 10 seconds, 1 minute and 5 minutes acted as a psychological catalyst that urged players to make a move For both fluctuations at 5mins and 1min, we can see the curves for normal moves peak earlier than the other type of moves and the other moves almost peaked at the same time. However, dubious moves happened the most when there are 5 minutes left while mistake moves happened the most when there is only 1 minute left. When the time left is less than 10 seconds, the distribution of the moves changed. Normal moves are made the most. For Time Spent: Normal moves are made fast. Normal moves may be obvious given the position Normal moves may be automatically played during the opening. Blunder takes more average time than any other type of move. This is less obvious. We think blunders are made fast without thought. Mistakes also take more time than normal moves. This is a heatmap of Time Left - Time Spent per type of move. It becomes evident that people play bad moves early in the game 5.1.2 Time ratio by Move Letâ€™s define ratio = Time Spent / Time. This concept of ratio is helpful in the sense that the person could have spent more time considering the position. For instance, given 1 second of time left and the player makes a move in 1 second, then there is less possibility that the player would have detected a better move. However, given 60 second of time left and the player makes a move in 1 second and blunder, this is a bad decision and probably the player should have thought more before they made the move. ## X Type mean std ## 1 1 dubious 0.1424937 0.1303141 ## 2 2 mistake 0.1668489 0.1409064 ## 3 3 blunder 0.1771698 0.1542783 ## 4 4 normal 0.2248049 0.1818782 From this graph, The mean of normal moves are much higher than other moves. Normal moves are a result of higher ratio of Time Spent / Time. Dubious moves are most likely intended or result of bad understanding early on in the game. Mistakes and blunders are also a result of not enough thinking. Players could have spent much more time thinking about the position and not blundering. 5.1.3 Quality of move during low time ratio Players have to make decisions in a short period of time 5.2 Investigating how the games ended Most of the games end normally with results of either one of the players win or the match is tied. However, we see that over 10% of the games ended with someone ran out of time. From this graph, The majority of matches ended within 25 moves, however, matches that end with one player ran out of time were mostly happening at 35 moves. Number of matches ended with the reason of rules infraction is neglectable. 5.2.1 Time left and time ratio when the losers ran out of run It could be seen that the majority of players who won because their opponent ran out of time had suffucient time left. Most of them had more than 30 seconds left. Considering time forfeit games only, time ratio of the winner are mostly below 12.5% "],["404.html", "Page not found", " Page not found The page you requested cannot be found (perhaps it was moved or renamed).
