In todays world, more than millions of people played everyday. According to a press release by AGON, 605 million adults play chess regularly, which is comparable to the number of regular users of Facebook. Thanks to the two biggest platforms for online chess, Chess and Lichess, either new players or experienced players could match-make with people with similar skill levels. While the rules for chess is simple and easy to learn, it is all about thinking and strategy. The number of ways to play go exponential after each move. 400 possible setup exist after one move by each player and there are 197742 possible game after the second round of move. The possible number of game goes up to 121 million after the three pair of moves which is why it is always a popular topic for ai research company. For this project, we took advantage of the open database of Lichess.org that provides up to 1 billion games of data per month to analyze and discover insightful takeaways for future researchers on this topic. 1.2 Specific Libraries Used 1.2.1 Rchess A package developed by Joshua Kunst that wraps the chess.js javascript library and the chessboardjs library for analyzing chess move, piece movement and check detection.

PGN (Portable Game Format) is often used when people write down moves from the start of the game. PGN can also include data such as event names, players, ELO, and results. FEN (Forsyth-Edwards Notation) is a simplified shorter notation that can describe one position. FEN has the disadvantage of not being able to encode data outside of chess position such as move order, player names, ELO, and results. In this project, we will be following chess games from the start of the game thus will be using the PGN format as the base format. The following encode the same chess game or chess position. 2.1.1 Image of the position Sample Position 2.1.2 - Sample PGN [Event EDAV chess tournament] [Site Columbia University, NYC] [Date December 1st] [Round 1] [White student A] [Black student B] [Result 1-0] e4 1e5 2.Nf3 2Nc6 1-0 2.1.3 - Sample FEN r1bqkbnr/pppp1ppp/2n5/4p3/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 2 3 2.2 Choosing the right data There are many online data sets that include chess PGN. For instance, CRAN Project RChess has its data set chesswc which is a collection of chess games from the FIDE World Cup 2011, 2013, and 2015. However, for the purpose of our project, there were a specific set of requirements that had to be sufficed: Sufficient amount of chess games Evaluation of every move Clock after every move The First requirement is relatively simple to achieve. However, very few chess data sets include computer evaluation and clock time in their PGNs. The second and third requirements are not part of the original PGN notation making it the limiting factor for our choice of data set. We decided to use the data from lichess database. The project decided to use the October 2021 games that included 88,092,721 games played online in lichess.org. Some of the games in the database encoded evaluation and clock time after every move. 2.3 Lichess Game Data Format lichess_db_standard_rated_2021-10.pgn Total 88,092,721 games. The file can be downloaded from database.lichess.org. The file is a list of PGNs without index. All of the following data sets are results of organizing this data. Not all games from the database is guaranteed to have [%clk] or [%eval] which are the clock time and the evaluation of the position. According to the Lichess database, around 6% of the games are annotated with evaluation. The following is a sample PGN format Lichess uses.

Total 78,867,621 lines. The 600+0_index.csv was created to work with a manageable size of data. The columns of the data was identical to moves_index.csv. "],["data-transformation.html", "Chapter 3 Data transformation 3.1 Understanding the Raw Data 3.2 Formatting the Raw Data", " Chapter 3 Data transformation 3.1 Understanding the Raw Data The raw data was in a zipped format of .pgn.bz2. The unzipped .pgn file was then converted through read.py. The result of this transformation was named data_index.csv each constituting of 10,000,000 lines. Naturally, there were 9 files since the total count of games in the original data was 88,092,721. Each row represented a game with columns Result1, UTCDate2, UTCTime3, WhiteElo4, BlackElo5, WhiteRatingDiff6, BlackRatingDiff7, ECO8, TimeControl9, Termination10, Evaluation11. This data_index.csv was only generated to answer the following questions. What items are missing in the original data? How much games were annotated? The answer to the first question will be answered in the next chapter. From the data, we deduced that 7,142,630 / 88,092,721 = 8.1 % of the games were annotated compared to the 6 % claimed on the website. 3.2 Formatting the Raw Data We decided to focus on the 7,142,630 games that were annotated. The first formatting process was done using eval.py. This process was different from the read.py that the resulting csv(pgn_index.csv) from eval.py contained the PGN descriptions of every game played. This process was conducted to generate a working csv dataset independent from the original dataset. The second formatting process used edit.py. The formatting process intended to change each row to moves instead of games. Each move was associated with Result12, WhiteElo13, BlackElo14, ECO15, TimeControl16, Termination17, Color18, MoveNum19, Move20, Type21, Eval22, EvalDiff23, Time24, TimeSpent25. The missing data of this csv data set will be examined in the next chapter. 464,436,334 annotated moves have been played but this dataset was impossible to work with. Time Control Distribution We decided to focus on the most popular time control format 600 + 0 or 10 minutes with no increment. This time format is 16.91 % of all games. By choosing this time format, we were able to conduct a deeper analysis on the relationship between time and bad moves. Result of the game. UTC date of the game. UTC time of the game.

They are the WhiteELOdiff and the BlackElodiff Columns.
