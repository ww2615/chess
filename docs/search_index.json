PGN (Portable Game Format) is often used when people write down moves from the start of the game. PGN can also include data such as event names, players, ELO, and results. FEN (Forsyth-Edwards Notation) is a simplified shorter notation that can describe one position. FEN has the disadvantage of not being able to encode data outside of chess position such as move order, player names, ELO, and results. In this project, we will be following chess games from the start of the game thus will be using the PGN format as the base format. The following encode the same chess game or chess position.

For instance, CRAN Project RChess has its data set chesswc which is a collection of chess games from the FIDE World Cup 2011, 2013, and 2015. However, for the purpose of our project, there were a specific set of requirements that had to be sufficed: Sufficient amount of chess games Evaluation of every move Clock after every move The First requirement is relatively simple to achieve. However, very few chess data sets include computer evaluation and clock time in their PGNs. The second and third requirements are not part of the original PGN notation making it the limiting factor for our choice of data set. We decided to use the data from lichess database. The project decided to use the October 2021 games that included 88,092,721 games played online in lichess.org. Some of the games in the database encoded evaluation and clock time after every move. 2.3 Lichess game data format Not all games from the database is guaranteed to have [%clk] or [%eval] which are the clock time and evaluation of the position. According to the lichess database, around 6% of the games are annotated with evaluation.
