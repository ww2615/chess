The unzipped .pgn file was then converted through read.py. The result of this transformation was named data_index.csv each constituting of 10,000,000 lines. Naturally, there were 9 files since the total count of games in the original data was 88,092,721. Each row represented a game with columns Result1, UTCDate2, UTCTime3, WhiteElo4, BlackElo5, WhiteRatingDiff6, BlackRatingDiff7, ECO8, TimeControl9, Termination10, Evaluation11. This data_index.csv was only generated to answer the following questions. What items are missing in the original data? How much games were annotated? The answer to the first question will be answered in the next chapter. From the data, we deduced that 7,142,630 / 88,092,721 = 8.1 % of the games were annotated compared to the 6 % claimed on the website. 3.2 Formatting the Raw Data We decided to focus on the 7,142,630 games that were annotated. The first formatting process was done using eval.py. This process was different from the read.py that the resulting csv(pgn_index.csv) from eval.py contained the PGN descriptions of every game played. This process was conducted to generate a working csv dataset independent from the original dataset. The second formatting process used edit.py. The formatting process intended to change each row to moves instead of games. Each move was associated with Result12, WhiteElo13, BlackElo14, ECO15, TimeControl16, Termination17, Color18, MoveNum19, Move20, Type21, Eval22, EvalDiff23, Time24, TimeSpent25. The missing data of this csv data set will be examined in the next chapter. Result of the game. UTC date of the game. UTC time of the game. White players Elo in Lichess. Black players Elo in Lichess. Change in White players Elo after the game. Change in Black players Elo after the game. Encyclopedia of Chess Openings. The Opening that was played in the game. The time format in which the game was played. Ex) 10 minutes + 5 second increment = 600+5. How the game ended. Ex) Normal(checkmate or resignation), Abandoned(player left the game), Time Forfeit (player ran out of time). Whether or not the game was annotated. Result of the game. White players Elo in Lichess. Black players Elo in Lichess. Encyclopedia of Chess Openings. The Opening that was played in the game. The time format in which the game was played. Ex) 10 minutes + 5 second increment = 600+5. How the game ended. Ex) Normal(checkmate or resignation), Abandoned(player left the game), Time Forfeit (player ran out of time). The color of the player that made the move. The number of the move. The algebraic notation of the move made. ex) Qh4. One of the seven types of move: blunder, mistake, dubious, normal, interesting, good, and brilliant. Computer evaluation after the move. The change in evaluation. It is 0 when the previous or current evaluation was forced mate (#number). Time left for the player. Time spent on the move.
