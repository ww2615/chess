Book link: https://ww2615.github.io/chessgame_analysis/

*This repo was initially generated from a bookdown template available here: https://github.com/jtr13/EDAVtemplate.*	




### Render the book

- [ ] 1. Install **bookdown** with `install.packages("bookdown")`. If you already have it, update to the most recent version.

- [ ] 2. Render locally with `bookdown::render_book("index.Rmd")` or clicking the *Build book* button which should appear in the Build tab (in the same pane as Environment, History, Connections, ...).

- [ ] 3. Use `browseURL("docs/index.html")` to view your book locally (or just open `index.html` in a browser).

- [ ] 4. If it looks good, commit and push all changed files to GitHub. 

(You will need to repeat steps 2 and 4 every time you wish to update the book online.)
