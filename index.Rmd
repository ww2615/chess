## Background

Chess is one of the most popular games in the world which could be dated back to the 15th century. In today's world, more than millions of people played everyday. According to a press release by AGON, 605 million adults play chess regularly, which is comparable to the number of regular users of Facebook. Thanks to the two biggest platforms for online chess, Chess and Lichess, either new players or experienced players could match-make with people with similar skill levels.  

While the rules for chess is simple and easy to learn, it is all about thinking and strategy. The number of ways to play go exponential after each move. 400 possible setup exist after one move by each player and there are 197742 possible game after the second round of move. The possible number of game goes up to 121 million after the three pair of moves which is why it is always a popular topic for ai research company. For this project, we took advantage of the open database of Lichess.org that provides up to 1 billion games of data per month to analyze and discover insightful takeaways for future researchers on this topic.
